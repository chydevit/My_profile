# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! This is a sample post to demonstrate the capabilities of MDX.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js is awesome because it allows us to build React applications with features like:

- **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**: Dynamic rendering for every request.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-rendering at build time for speed.
- **API Routes**: Building backend endpoints within the same project.

## Code Example

Here's how you might write a simple component in React:

```tsx
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

## Using Components in MDX

Since this is MDX, we can also use React components directly in our markdown!

<div className="p-4 bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900/30 rounded-lg border border-primary-200 dark:border-primary-800 my-4">
  This is a detailed box rendered from a standard HTML div with Tailwind classes, right inside markdown!
</div>
